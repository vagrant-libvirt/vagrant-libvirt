This is a [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com) plugin that adds a
[Libvirt](http://libvirt.org) provider to Vagrant, allowing Vagrant to
control and provision machines via Libvirt toolkit.

**Note:** Actual version is still a development one. Feedback is welcome and
can help a lot :-)

## Installing

Installation typically involves a number of distribution package dependencies to ensure that Libvirt is available.
Recommend that you follow the [installation guide](https://vagrant-libvirt.github.io/vagrant-libvirt/installation.html).

## Running

Once installed, use vagrant-libvirt through vagrant.

Locate a vagrant box containing the distribution you want to use at
[Vagrant Cloud](https://app.vagrantup.com/boxes/search?provider=libvirt) and
initialize.

```shell
vagrant init fedora/32-cloud-base
```

Then run following command:

```shell
vagrant up --provider=libvirt
```

Vagrant needs to know that we want to use Libvirt and not default VirtualBox.
That's why there is `--provider=libvirt` option specified. Other way to tell
Vagrant to use Libvirt provider is to setup environment variable

```shell
export VAGRANT_DEFAULT_PROVIDER=libvirt
```

Afterwards to enter the VM simply use:
```shell
vagrant ssh
```

If you can't find a box that works as you need, have a look at our documentation
on [creating boxes](https://vagrant-libvirt.github.io/vagrant-libvirt/boxes.html#creating-boxes)
on how to take existing ones, customize them and repackage.

## Development

To work on the `vagrant-libvirt` plugin, clone this repository out, and use
[Bundler](http://gembundler.com) to get the dependencies:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/vagrant-libvirt/vagrant-libvirt.git
cd vagrant-libvirt
bundle install
```

Once you have the dependencies, verify the unit tests pass with `rspec`:

```shell
export VAGRANT_HOME=$(mktemp -d)
bundle exec rspec --fail-fast --color --format documentation
```

If those pass, you're ready to start developing the plugin.

Setting `VAGRANT_HOME` is to avoid issues with conflicting with other
plugins/gems or data already present under `~/.vagrant.d`.

Additionally if you wish to test against a specific version of vagrant you
can control the version using the following before running the tests:

```shell
export VAGRANT_VERSION=v2.2.14
bundle update && bundle exec rspec --fail-fast --color --format documentation
```

**Note** rvm is used by the maintainers to help provide an environment to test
against multiple ruby versions that align with the ones used by vagrant for
their embedded ruby depending on the release. You can see what version is used
by looking at the current [unit tests](.github/workflows/unit-tests.yml)
workflow. By default if you have rvm installed and enabled it this project looks
to use ruby 2.6.6 and configures a separate gemset, both of which will be switched
to each time you enter the project directory.

You can test the plugin without installing it into your Vagrant environment by
just creating a `Vagrantfile` in the top level of this directory (it is
gitignored) that uses it. You can add the following line to your Vagrantfile
while in development to ensure vagrant checks that the plugin is installed:

```ruby
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vagrant.plugins = "vagrant-libvirt"
end
```
Or add the following to the top of the file to ensure that any required plugins
are installed globally:
```ruby
REQUIRED_PLUGINS = %w(vagrant-libvirt)
exit unless REQUIRED_PLUGINS.all? do |plugin|
  Vagrant.has_plugin?(plugin) || (
    puts "The #{plugin} plugin is required. Please install it with:"
    puts "$ vagrant plugin install #{plugin}"
    false
  )
end
```

Now you can use bundler to execute Vagrant:

```shell
$ bundle exec vagrant up --provider=libvirt
```

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** bundle is crucial. You need to use bundled Vagrant.
